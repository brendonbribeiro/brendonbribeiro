## Hey! How did you get here? üòÖ
Since you're here, my name is Brendon Ribeiro, and I've been working as a developer for over 9 years (a long road covered, and a journey to come üåÄ). In those years I developed more, in what caught my attention, mainly **Node and React**, developing performative APIs and following code standards, and by consuming them I was able to give the user a memorable experience. Above you can see a list of the technologies I'm most knowledgeable about üëÜüëÜüëÜ
